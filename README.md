## Notes on the test

I didn't have access to the Futura font so I used one that was similar but obviously this impacts some of how the page looks compared to the design.

I have not included a links component for the breadcrumbs as I had no links but this is something I would do in the real world environment.

Creating a gradient border for the carousel cards proved tricky so I replaced it with the grey.

I am aware that the final image in the carousel cuts off. With more time I would sort a fix for this.

In a real world environment I would make the application responsive for different screen sizes.
